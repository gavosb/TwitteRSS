# TwitteRSS
A simple twitter RSS generator with a graphical interface.

I intended this to be a twitter RSS reader for a calmer experience while keeping up to date with the world, but I've decided to move on to a more interesting project upon realizing that there are already twitter RSS plugins for several RSS readers. May this be of use to whoever comes across this; it's a pretty decent GUI example and I'm sure the RSS scraper might help someone with something, somewhere at some time.
